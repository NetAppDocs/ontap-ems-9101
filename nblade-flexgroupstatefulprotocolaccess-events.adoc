== Nblade.flexgroupStatefulProtocolAccess
*Severity*::
ERROR
*Description*::
This message occurs when a client tries to access a FlexGroup through a stateful protocol, like SMB1. Currently only NFSv3 mounts and SMB2+ share are supported by FlexGroups.
*Corrective Action*::
Make sure a FlexGroup supported protocol is specified for all client mount operations through which a FlexGroup can be accessed. If using NFSv3, consider specifying 'nfsvers=3' as an option for the 'mount' command on all clients accessing a FlexGroup.
*Syslog Message*::
Attempt to access FlexGroup with MSID %u with %s denied.
*Parameters*::
*msid* (INT): MSID of the FlexGroup being accessed.
*protocol* (STRING): Client protocol.
